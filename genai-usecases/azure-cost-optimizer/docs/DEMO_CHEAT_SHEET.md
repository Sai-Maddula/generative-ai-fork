## 🔥 IF YOU ONLY REMEMBER 3 THINGS

1. **PAUSE at HITL checkpoint** - that's your differentiator
2. **Say "30 seconds"** after agent execution - contrast with "hours"
3. **Smile when it works** - confidence is contagious

---

## 🚨 EMERGENCY BACKUP

**If live demo fails:**
1. Don't panic (smile, stay calm)
2. Say: "Let me show you this via the recorded version"
3. Switch to pre-recorded video
4. Narrate over it as if live

**If a question interrupts:**
1. "Great question!"
2. "Let me finish this workflow, then I'll address that"
3. Or: "I'll show you that in 30 seconds"

---

## ✅ PRE-DEMO CHECKLIST

**60 minutes before:**
- [ ] Login to app, verify it loads
- [ ] Close all other browser tabs
- [ ] Disable notifications
- [ ] Test microphone
- [ ] Glass of water nearby

**5 minutes before:**
- [ ] Refresh app to reset state
- [ ] Set zoom to 125%

## 🎯 SUCCESS = AUDIENCE SAYING:

- "When can we pilot this?"
- "Does this work with our environment?"
- "What's the pricing?"
- "Can you integrate with Slack?"

These mean they're already imagining it in production. **Mission accomplished.**

---

**FINAL REMINDER:**
Speak 10% slower than feels natural.
Pause 2 seconds after each "wow moment."
End with energy, not trailing off.

**YOU'VE GOT THIS.** 🚀
